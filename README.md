## Installation

You need to have [Paper](https://papermc.io/) (or fork of paper) installed on your server. FairyChat is not
compatible
with other server software.

1. Download the latest FairyChat version from [here](https://github.com/rexlManu/FairyChat/releases).
2. Place the downloaded jar file in your server's `plugins` folder.
3. Restart your server.
4. Configure FairyChat to your liking.
5. Restart your server again.

### Recommended Plugin

It's recommended to install [FreedomChat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/freedomchat) alongside FairyChat. FreedomChat
fixes the issue with random kicks because
of invalid chat signatures.
